/*I used many CSS properties that we didn't use in class that I investigated and incorperated into my website, and example could be how I we have never used GIFs in any of our websites, in addition I also incorperated a way in which the color of the links change when you have and haven't clicked on it, finally I investigated about margins to make my website look cleaner and incorperated it as well*/
