  <h4>What I learned</h4></center>
  <p>When it comes to HTML I first learned that HTML means Hyper Mark Up Language. This is something I did not know before we started learning HTML language. The next thing I learned how important the less than (<) and greater than (>) signs are. You are supposed to put each and every tag inside of them with a / to close the tag. I learned all different types of tags starting with the header tags, then the paragraph tags, then the style tags, then the break tags, then the image tag, then the list tags, both ordered and unordered, then the link tag and finally table tags. To sum everything up, HTML has many tags in order to organize and make your website in many different ways.</p>
  <center><h4>Why is it important?</h4></center>
  <p>HTML is important to learn because it is what makes up all websites on the internet making it one of the most important and widely known languages in the world. It is something basic that you have to know for the future.</p></center>

  <h4>What I learned</h4></center>
  <p>CSS also has a meaning which is Cascading Style Sheets. It is a way in which you can style your website in many different ways, what we learned in class is a very shallow view at what CSS actally can be. We learned tags like the color tag, the hight/width tag, the font tag, the link tag, the list tag, the table tag, and the backgroung tag. We learned that CSS has a extremely wide spectrum of tags that can be used to decorate your website to become visually appealing for the audience visiting it. Each day people are adding new CSS tags to the language to make a website as creative as possible.</p>
  <center><h4>Why is it important?</h4></center>
  <p>CSS is very important to learn because like HTML it is also a language that is used in most if not every website in the world in order to make in visually appealing to the audience visiting it. If a website is not visually appealing the website will not be a success and will not get any visitors.</p>
